  "content": "**Why Choose Ratify?**\n\n* **Transparent**\n* **Reliable**\n* **An Active Voice**\n\nWe are a validator for the people.Â \n\nWe aim to value-add and strengthen the networks we participate in through a few key pillars: Education, News and Community Engagement. \n\n**Education**\n\nThe space we are operating in is one that is nascent and has a lot of room to grow. Consequently, with growth comes the exploration of the unknown. To many users, it may be hard to keep up with the ever-constant changing space and pace of developments. We want to help all stakeholders to understand what it means to be a participant in the space, and how they may do so. \n\nWe aim to accomplish this through bite-sized tips on our social media channels, with the eventual aim of partnering with known influencers in our network to develop other forms of content. \n\n**News**\n\nIt is not enough to simply understand the way the world works. One must also keep pace with the new developments. Of course, not every development is relevant to every stakeholder. We appreciate that time is a resource which is being wrestled away from other priorities. For our delegates, we want to provide value through clean, bite-sized feed from our social channels. \n\n**Community Engagement**\n\nWe believe that life should be fun. Beyond demystifying jargon and new developments, we want the community to remain engaged through events, town halls, and games that we will organise with partners in our network.\n\nWe have seen far too many validators being silent on key community events or even failing to participate in Governance altogether. Moreover, it is our belief that a portion of fees generated from running a validator should be channelled back to the community through efforts such as Education, Analytics and Community Engagement.",
